# K-Means-CLUSTERING
Clustering algorithms are unsupervised machine learning algorithms so there is no label associated with data points. Clustering algorithms look for similarities or dissimilarities among data points so that similar ones can be grouped together.  K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible. The ‘means’ in the K-means refers to averaging of the data; that is, finding the centroid.  To process the learning data, the K-means algorithm in data mining starts with a first group of randomly selected centroids, which are used as the beginning points for every cluster, and then performs iterative (repetitive) calculations to optimize the positions of the centroids  It halts creating and optimizing clusters when either:  1. The centroids have stabilized — there is no change in their values because the clustering has been successful. 2. The defined number of iterations has been achieved.
